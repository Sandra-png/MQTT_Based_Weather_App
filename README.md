**Author:** Sandra  
**Project Type:** IoT Data Publisher  
**Tags:** MQTT, Python, Docker, EMQX, Paho

## Description

This project simulates a weather sensor using Python and publishes mock weather data to an MQTT broker every 60 seconds. It's built with the `paho-mqtt` client library and runs inside a Docker container for easy portability.

# Features
- Publishes random weather data every 60 seconds
- Uses a public MQTT broker (`broker.emqx.io`)
- Works standalone with Python or in a Docker container
